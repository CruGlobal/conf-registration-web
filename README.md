## Development Environment Setup
1. Install NodeJS. This will vary depending on your Operating System.
2. Run `npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli` in your terminal to install Yeoman, Bower, Grunt, and their dependencies.
3. Clone this repo and open a terminal in that folder.
4. Run `npm install` to install the command line tools.
5. Run `bower install` to install the web app dependencies.
6. Run `grunt server`. That command should open a browser and now you can code!
