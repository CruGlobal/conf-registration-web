<h3>What Information Is Collected?</h3>

<p>"Personally identifiable information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

EventHub also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request.

<h3>Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?</h3>

<p>EventHub does not rent, sell or share personally identifiable information it collects about you or phone numbers it observes in conjunction with use of your account to or with third parties. EventHub may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary.</p>

<p>We will take reasonable precautions to protect personally identifiable information in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is, however, 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
